  "On Nutrition Facts food labels, the grams of dietary fiber are already
  included in the total carbohydrate count.  But because fiber is a type of
  carbohydrate that your body canâ€™t digest, it does not affect your blood sugar
  levels. You should subtract the grams of fiber from the total carbohydrate."
